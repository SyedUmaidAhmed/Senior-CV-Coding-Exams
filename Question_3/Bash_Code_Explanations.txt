Explanation of Each Method
Using sed:

sed is a stream editor. The -n option suppresses automatic printing of pattern space. '10p' tells sed to print only the 10th line.
Using awk:

awk is a powerful text processing tool. NR==10 is an awk condition that triggers an action (default print) when the record number (line number) is 10.
Using head and tail:

head -n 10 file.txt prints the first 10 lines of the file.
tail -n 1 then takes the last line from the output of head, which is the 10th line of the original file.
Using a bash script:

This script first checks if file.txt exists. If it does, it uses sed to print the 10th line.
